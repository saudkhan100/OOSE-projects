**TimeTable Management System **

A timetable management system is a software application that helps users create, manage, and organize their schedules. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as managing academic timetables.
The system allows users to input their schedules, and then generates a visual representation of the timetable that can be easily viewed and modified as needed. Admin can add, delete, or modify, and the system will automatically update the timetable accordingly

**Vision**
The high-level goals of the timetable management system for a university are to improve scheduling efficiency, reduce conflicts, and increase overall productivity. The system should be able to handle a large number of users, including students, faculty, and staff, and be able to handle complex scheduling requirements, such as room and resource allocation.
The constraints of the system include the need to integrate with existing university systems, such as student and faculty databases, and the need to adhere to strict privacy and security protocols to protect sensitive data.
